# **DESCRIPTION**

Decision Tree Implementation involves the classification of emails using Decision Tree classifier. The model is trained on dummy data for the learning purpose and understanding the working of decision tree to generate output results. The given notebook contains the following stages of model training:

    1. Splitting training and test dataset.
    2. Handling missing values.
    3. Model training with hyperparameter tuning.
    4. Visualization of decision tree classification model.
    5. Model performance


## Splitting training and test dataset
Data splitting is essential in machine learning to ensure that a model generalizes well to unseen data. Typically, a dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets. The training set is used to train the model by adjusting its parameters, while the validation set helps in tuning hyperparameters and preventing overfitting. Finally, the test set evaluates the model's performance on completely new data, providing an estimate of how well it will perform in real-world scenarios. Without proper data splitting, a model might learn patterns specific to the training data but fail to generalize, leading to poor predictions on new inputs.

## Handling missing values
Handling missing values is crucial in data preprocessing because they can negatively impact a machine learning model's performance. Missing values can lead to biased or inaccurate predictions, as many algorithms cannot process incomplete data. If not handled properly, they may introduce inconsistencies, reduce model accuracy, or cause errors during training. Common strategies for handling missing values include removing rows or columns with missing data, imputing values using statistical techniques (mean, median, or mode), or using machine learning algorithms that can handle missing values effectively. Properly addressing missing data ensures the dataset remains reliable, improving the model's ability to generalize to unseen data.

## Model training with hyperparameter tuning
Decision Tree Classification model is trained with best parameters using hyperparameter tuning which involves GridSearch method to find best parameters for hyperparameter tuning.

## Decision Tree Visualization
This includes the representation of decision tree making splits based on various rules based on input features. The representation is shown below:
